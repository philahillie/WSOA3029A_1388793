        <h2>THIS WEEK'S REVIEW: GAME OF THRONES</h2>

        <p>
            This week, we decided to weigh in on a television classic that has stirred up 
            admiration, fandoms and controversy over one of the most contested 
            finales to date. 
        </p>
        <p>
            IMDb has given Game of Thrones (GoT) an aggregate rating of 9.2 out of 10 and 
            we thought it would be interesting to analyse the interest amongst male and female 
            viewers across different age groups 
        </p>

        <p class="graphOneHeading" >MEN&apos;SRATING OF GoT</p>
          <svg class = "viz" height ="330" width="400">  

          </svg>

        <p class="graphOneHeading" >WOMEN&apos;S RATING OF GoT</p>
          <svg class = "vizTwo" height ="330" width="400">  

          </svg> 

        <p>
            The graphs show that generally, men and women across most of the age 
            groups (under 18, 18 to 29 years old, 30 to 44 years old and older 
            than 45 years old) have rated the show between 9 and 10 out of 10. 
            However, women aged under 18 years old rated the series an average 
            of 7.4 out of 10. We think the sexualisation and violence against 
            women may be jarring for teenage girls and this could contribute to 
            the dip in ratings. Despite the dip in rating, the show is generally 
            favoured by most audiences and the team here at the Popcorn Crew 
            definitely recommend this cult classic to our readers. Yes, it is 
            a fantasy, war, period piece but it has themes that can appeal to 
            many people and it brings the suspense and drama from the first 
            episode.

        <h2>POPULAR FILMS</h2>
        <p>
            Everyone has a &quot;Must-See Movies&quot; and while tast is sucjective, we decided to etst 
            out movie databases to see how accurate they are. Be warned, the films that were recommended by the 
            database are quite old BUT, as son as we saw that &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;The Dark 
            Knight&quot; AND &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; were on this list we knew that we had to give this 
            Top 10 a try. We hope you enjoy and let us know which films you think have to go and which can stay!         
        </p>
