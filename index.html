            <h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>
            <p>
                We are film enthusiasts who are looking to create a community in which we share films 
                that really moved us, changed our lives, made us laugh and made us think outside 
                of our box. We share our recommendations, thoughts on cult favourites and 
                provied our own critiques on the films we have watched. 

            </p>
            <p>
                As film and cinema enthusiasts, we are also interested in the state of cinema 
                and what that means for metrics such as the box office and how production companies 
                are or will have to adapt. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We love everything film and we want to share those those moments and thoughts with you! 
                So sit back, relax and enjoy the show!
            </p>
            <p>
                with love, The Popcorn Crew
