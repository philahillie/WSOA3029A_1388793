            This website aims to analyse trends in the film and television world by providing 
            data surrounding the ratings, the audiences and also (hopefully) through investigating 
            the possible impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on ratings and earnings of films and 
            television shows.  
        </p>
        <p>
           Film and television are visual mediums and thus I thought communicating its data thorugh 
           the use of data visualisation would be pair up nicely. Usually, statistics surrounding film and 
           television are more descriptive so I wanted to use this opportunity to create 
           concise and easy to read summaries or audiences and film lovers so they could feel 
           part of the whole film experience.
