                In my previous blog post, I analysed a data-driven artwork designed by Yoshiyuki 
                Mikami and further explored by Joshua Smith in which images of endangered 
                animals were compiled with the same number of pixels as there are those 
                animals in real life. I found this campaign powerful because it gave a simple 
                visual representation of the dwindling number of animals left within the 
                respective endangered animal species. The images that depicted animals that 
                were on the verge of extinction as heavily pixelated and barely recognisable 
                and thus played on the idea of the animals becoming a distant memory or part 
                of our past history due to their impending extinction. As someone who 
                responds to visuals quicker than text, I appreciated being able to interpret 
                the message of this campaign quickly.

                According to Nicholas Diakopoulos, data-driven storytelling should &quot;seek 
                truth and report it as fully as possible&quot;, &quot;be transparent&quot; and &quot;engage 
                the community&quot; (Diakopoulos, 2018). An element of data-driven storytelling that 
                I believe was used well was the idea of quantification which looks at how 
                measurements are defined. Quantification considers whether what is measured 
                in the data allows for a given story to be faithful to reality (Diakopoulos, 2018) 
                and I believe that pixilation of the images of the animals is a smart way to 
                quantify the existing umber of animals within a species are left and the 
                reality that it reveals does not mislead end-users. It highlights how dire 
                the circumstance of animals on the endangered species list is. The artists 
                further provided context for the data by mentioning that the endangered 
                animal species list and its numbers were provided by National Geographic. 
                This gives the data credibility (as it is an organisation considered with 
                providing information about animals). While the images cannot be 100% 
                accurate with regard to relaying the exact number of animals left to the 
                number of pixels in the image, the message is still conveyed and gives the 
                end-users insight into the campaign (Diakopoulos). The additional annotation 
                minimises the possibility of anything detracting from the message of the 
                artwork.

                When I think of my data-driven artworks, I also think of the space that 
                they exist in, my website. This has informed the style guide of my website 
                as I want the data-driven storytelling to blend well into the narrative of 
                my site. I view my site as the context that will aid in minimising the 
                end-user from being distracted.
