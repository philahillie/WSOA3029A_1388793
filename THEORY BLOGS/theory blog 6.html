        ANALYSIS OF A CASE STUDY FROM INFORMATIONISBEAUTIFUL.NET

            <p>
                The diagram I decided to analyse was one that detailed how the 
                human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has helped decrease HPV 
                infections in sexually active females over a period of eleven 
                years (2003 to 2014). The diagram states that from 2003 to 2006, 
                the prevalence of HPV infections among sexually active women 
                aged between 14 and 24 was at 54%. However, the prevalence of 
                the HPV infection dropped significantly to 0.9% between 2011 and 
                2014. This graph does a good job at communicating the story and 
                what is being communicated to viewers. It makes great use of 
                visual hierarchy as the viewer is drawn to the large font of 
                the title that informs the viewer about what is being discussed 
                and further highlights the word &quot;infections&quot; through the use of 
                a different but bright colour. The colour that &quot;infections&quot; has 
                been highlighted in is the same colour that the numerical value 
                of the infections has been displayed in the diagram thus one is 
                able to conclude that the infections and the percentages are 
                linked.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The subheading states that the information applies to a percentage 
                of sexually active females who are aged between 14 and 24 years 
                old. This subheading gives the data context but is displayed in 
                a slightly darker colour so that it is not the first thing that 
                grabs he attention of viewers. This same principle is applied 
                to the circular diagrams as a way of displaying the percentages 
                of infections within the context of 100% so people can see just 
                how much the percentage of infections has decreased. The &quot;efore 
                vaccine&quot; and &quot;after vaccine&quot; is displayed in a font that is not 
                as bold as the main title but is still just as bright as it is 
                an important piece of information that tracks the progress of 
                the vaccine of the eleven years (which have been de-emphasized).  
            </p>
            <p>
                The diagram that illustrates the amount of infects between 2003 
                and 2006 is smaller than the second diagram as the authors want 
                to draw a focus on how the vaccine has essentially helped in 
                mitigating infections – hence the second diagram being larger. 
                I think this is also to ensure that the smaller percentage is 
                still visible and does not get lost or overshadowed by the bigger 
                percentage in the smaller diagram. While the background is inviting 
                and fun, I wonder if it is necessary. It does not detract from the 
                information and the understand of the information but if it were 
                placed in a website between other text, it might be better if 
                the background was plain so that more attention could be drawn to the 
                data.
