    <h1>REFLECTION ON MY DATA-DRIVEN ARTWORK</h1>

    <main>
        <article>
            <p>
                The data-driven artwork used on my website was inspired by the idea 
                of creating artwork that could resemble popcorn. I thought that 
                this would tie in nicely with the theme of the website and keep 
                the idea of critiquing films and television shows fun and 
                accessible. As mentioned in my rationale, the colour code of the 
                website is navy blue, to mimic the dark cinema rooms, with accents 
                of yellow and orange to imitate buttered popcorn and to add a 
                contrast and pop of colour to the website.   
            </p>
            <p>
                I struggled with executing the idea behind this artwork but I wanted to 
                make the radius of the circles within the bubble diagram to be 
                directly proportional to the ratings that they have on the Jikan 
                API. This would help viewers with detecting which series is the best 
                rated (Implied relationship) (Diakopoulos, 2018) and could possibly 
                influence the order in which they engage with the series. I wanted 
                the interaction component to be in the form of a description or 
                image that would pop up when the mouse hovered over each data 
                point. The pop-up feature would ideally have a poster of the 
                series, the name and the rating that it has been given. 
            </p>

                Despite the data coming from a different dataset, I wanted the 
                artwork to tie in with the theme of engaging with film and 
                television reviews and finding ways to engage and possibly 
                critique them. This website often discusses English language 
                films and television shows and one could argue that it is biased 
                towards them. I wanted to create an artwork that interrogated our 
                biases and “defaults” (Diakopoulos, 2018) and that is why I felt 
                that it was important for the website to recommend films from 
                different film communities and I decided to do this by exploring 
                some of the &quot;top rated&quot; anime shows.

                The radiuses of the data points are not accurate but are 
                proportional and I did this to create data points that 
                could catch the eye more easily. A radius that would have 
                been 7.2 was illustrated as 72 to be more visible. 
                Yoshiyiki Mikami and Joshua Smith also adapted the 
                number of pixels to animals on the endeared species 
                list ratio to reflect the number of animals left while 
                still being able to be represents is a 7x7 or 8x8 image 
                (DL Cade. 2019).
