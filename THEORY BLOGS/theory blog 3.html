            My website is centred around film and will display the top film releases 
            each week (or two weeks). I plan on comparing sales data from 2018 (before 
            the pandemic) to those in 2021 (a year into the pandemic) and portray the 
            effect that the pandemic has had on films and the amount of money they 
            earn in the first week of box office sales. The idea is to summarise and 
            comment on the economic trends in film. In an attempt to get a better 
            scope, I have brainstormed analysing a specific genre or franchise of 
            films such as the ones from the Marvel Cinematic Universe in order to 
            analyse a smaller group of ewers and their interest in the films before 
            and during the pandemic. I plan on using the IMDb application programming 
            interface (API) which provides movie and television (TV) information, 
            IMDb ratings, metascore ratings, directs and other data. 
        </p>
        <p>
            User Experience (UX) principles state that websites should have a clear 
            hierarchy and I have done this by prioritising the film data and visuals 
            and having the theory blogs act as secondary information that would not b
            e placed at the top of the webpage. Another key element is having reactive 
            features on your website so viewers get feedback and see their actions in 
            real time. I plan on doing this through having a hover feature on the 
            navigation bar links and to also have a permanent hover on the menu 
            item/page that has been selected on the website so users can keep track 
            of which webpage they are on.    
        </p>

            The user interface (UI) deals with specific assets such as colour, 
            typography and images that the user will interact with. I am still 
            playing around with my colour scheme but, because the website will be name 
            &quot;Popcorn Crew&quot; I thought to make use of yellow for the effect of buttered 
            popcorn and the purple colour would act as a complimentary colour as per 
            the colour wheel but I was also considering using red to represent the red 
            curtains in a cinema. With regards to the typography, I have made use of 
            bold headings and possibly a font with a similar feel to a typewriter for 
            the articles to give the user and &quot;insider feel&quot; to the content and have 
            them feel as though they are behind the scenes with the film community.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I plan on using images and may embed videos of the trailers and reviews 
            of the films being discussed. I would like to also embed videos that discuss 
            the trends in film releases so that viewers can have video data that supports 
            the data visualisation.
