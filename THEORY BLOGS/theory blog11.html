        <h1>HOW ART CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ETHICAL REFLECTION ON RISKY TECHNOLOGIES </h1>

        <article>
            <p>
                When something is ethical, it can be described as &quot;relating to moral principles&quot; 
                (Oxford Languages). In her paper, Sabine Roeser describes risky technologies as 
                technologies that explore cloning and human enhancement, the hybridity of humans 
                and animals and hyperconnectivity. Roeser discusses how art has performed as a 
                tool that bridges the gap of understanding and allows people to see the 
                possibilities of risky technologies that are commonly not trusted by people. 
                The emergence of techno art – art that reflects on and engages with risky 
                technologies – has allowed for new and more open-minded views and interpretations 
                of risky technologies to be engaged with.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Historical examples of techno art would be the works of Leonardo da Vinci who 
                explored scientific developments within art. Many other artists took a 
                &quot;critical stance&quot; and movements such as Romanticism explored ideal world in 
                a pre-industrialised world (Roeser). Examples of techno art such as Frankenstein by 
                Mary Shelley have shaped people&apos;s suspicions towards technologies such as 
                human enhancement while others such as science fiction films have embraced 
                technology and have developed dystopian environments in which the possibilities 
                of risky technologies can be explored and communicated in a way that can appeal 
                to audiences. This has been done through the use of aesthetics, emotion and the 
                communication of ideas in a imaginative, provocative but playful way (Roeser).  
            </p>
            <p>
                Techno art engages with new technologies and presents opportunities for new 
                conversations around technological developments to be had. Stelarc, a performance 
                artist, developed a project that was an intersection of biology and art and 
                explored the ways in which we connect to each other in an age of hyperconnectivity. 
                In his project, he attached a third ear to this arm through the use of surgery and 
                using his own stem cells. He proposed that this was part of an extended Bluetooth 
                that could serve as a way in which people could connect to each other more 
                intimately. The &quot;Ear On Arm&quot; would become and &quot;internet organ for the body&quot; (Roeser) 
                which would eventually be developed into a wireless connection that could be 
                implanted into the ear.  This exploration of stem cell research goes beyond the 
                clinical approach that is presented by scientist and rather explores it in a 
                somewhat practical conceptual format.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Art invokes emotions and thus encourages critical thinking and reflection from 
                the emotional experience of engaging with the work, Art can help audiences replace 
                the barrier of suspicion with curiosity and this can lead to people being more open 
                minded (Roeser). Generally, I have not had a huge interest in stem cell research or 
                human enhancement but seeing an ear on someone&apos;s arm definitely sparked my 
                interested and made me wonder why and how that was done. This is how people 
                can get more knowledge and feel a part of the larger conversation surrounding 
                risky technologies.
