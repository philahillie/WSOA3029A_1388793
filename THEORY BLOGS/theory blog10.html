        <h1>CRITICAL REFLECTION ON MY OWN INTERACTIVE DATA</h1>

        <article>
            <p>
                Interactivity looks at how two things can work together and influence each other. It also looks 
                at the ability of a computer to respond to a user&apos;s input (Oxford Languages). My 
                first two graphs looked at the statistics of men and women who watched Game of 
                Thrones, a series adapted from George R. R. Martin’s novels and produced through 
                HBO. I decided to divide the data into four ages groups – teenagers, young adults, 
                adults and older adults. I used a scatter plot format to plot the data and 
                represented the two genders with different colours so people could see that the 
                graphs were representing different things 
            </p>
            <p>
                In retrospect, I would have liked for these graphs to be line graphs so that 
                people could see the dips in ratings more accurately. This would minimise the 
                time it takes to interpret the values that have been plotted. When I first read 
                the brief for the graphs, I thought I could create two of the same graphs as 
                long as they represented different data but was mistaken. I should have placed 
                the data in the same graph but possibly had two different polylines that could 
                clearly represent the similarities and differences of interest between men and 
                women in different age groups. Additional labels at the tail end of the polylines 
                would then be used so viewers could see which line represented men and women.  
            </p>
            <p>
                With regards to interactivity, once could add commentary or quotes that could 
                help affirm why the different genders and age groups were the way that they were. 
                For example, female teenagers were recorded as liking Game of Thrones the least 
                and this could be due to the violence and sexual abuse that has been displayed 
                in the show. I could attach short quotes or additional information that would 
                make users understand why female teenagers would not be the target audience for 
                a show like this. 
            </p>

                I enjoy the use of colour as it was easy to differentiate from the x and y axes 
                and the data that had been plotted. It was also easy to know which graph I was 
                looking at as the colours were different in each one. However, this use of colour 
                would have been more apparent in a polyline or bar graph.
