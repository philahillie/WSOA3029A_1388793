    <h1>ETHICS IN DATA-DRIVEN STORYTELLING</h1>

            <p>
                I understand the practice of ethical data-driven storytelling as the act of 
                presenting data or information that is as true as possible, transparent and 
                does not mislead end-users when they interpret the information. Stephen Ward 
                describes ethics as &quot;the study and practice of what constitutes the best 
                regulation of human conduct, individually and socially&quot;. Nicholas Diakopoulos 
                adds that ethics is about &quot;making sound editorial decisions along each step 
                of the data-driven storytelling process&quot; (Diakopoulos 2018). Diakopoulos 
                makes mention of two principles that pertain to ethical storytelling. The 
                first principle discusses how the relevancy of data stories and details how 
                &quot;opportunities for (mis)guiding end-users&apos; interpretation of data can arise 
                during every phase of production&quot; (Diakopoulos, 2018). These phases of 
                production are the acquisition, quantification, normalisation, aggregation, 
                filtering, visually encoded, annotated and interactive design of data. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The second principle discusses &quot;the ways in which insights from data are 
                found and interpreted as stories&quot; (Diakopoulos, 2018). It is important 
                for the storyteller to trace and disclose their rationale and process for 
                arriving at a preferred interpretation. This principle relates to the 
                acquisition and data transformation steps. The third principle advises 
                that &quot;the individual people who the data represents are to be treated 
                with humanity and respect and not be seen only as a means for telling a 
                story&quot; (Diakopoulos, 2018). It connects to the interactivity component 
                of data-driven storytelling and is a way for designers to engage with 
                the community. There are several steps in the process of data-driven 
                storytelling that are crucial to communicating information in an 
                ethical manner that can be understood and interpreted factually.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the acquisition step of data, provenance aims to &quot;provide a 
                baseline of transparency&quot; (Diakopoulos, 2018) and addresses the legal or 
                illegal acquiring of the data. It also looks at who produced the data, 
                what the intent of getting the data was and whether the data is complete, 
                timely and accurate. Quantification deals with how measurements of the 
                data are defined. Withing the data transformation process, normalisation 
                gives the end-user more freedom to make interpretation decisions on 
                their terms. I understand this to be the process of finding a mean or 
                average in which the data can be presented accurately but still factor 
                in changes or the possibility of differing interpretations. Aggregated 
                data is &quot;data that is derived through mathematical operations or 
                combinations&quot; (Diakopoulos, 2018). It is &quot;a consistent form of aggregation 
                that is applied to any data that are to be visually compared&quot; 
                (Diakopoulos, 2018). Steps such as filtering, conveying and connecting 
                insights, being mindful of implied relationships and giving data 
                context and annotations making it interactive help with the ethical 
                communication of data-driven storytelling and, when does right, 
                minimise opportunities more misleading end-users.

                Reading this chapter made me think about the way in which I have 
                communicated the ratings and television series I have discussed in my 
                blogs. My website deals with subjective metrics and opinions on what 
                makes a film or series good and thus I think it is important that I 
                site the sources I am getting my data from so that end-users are not 
                under the impression that the ratings I am presenting are what has been 
                provided by the whole population but rather by companies or organisations 
                that could potentially have their own biases. This is why I was inclined 
                to at least show male and female perspective so people could see what 
                the effect of gender may have on the ratings.
