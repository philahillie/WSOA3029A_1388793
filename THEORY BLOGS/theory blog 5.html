    <h1>A CLOSE READING AND REFLECTION ON KNAFLIC’S CHAPTER 6</h1>

            <p>
                In the sixth chapter of &quot;Storytelling with Data” by Knaflic, he discusses how data 
                and their representation in graphs can be represented. While graphs serve as 
                a simple representation of data that should be able to be interpreted many 
                people, adding more tools that make the interpretation process easier can be 
                done in a way that is informative and avoids looking cluttered. The graph in 
                model visual #1 makes use of x-axis and y-axis labels and numbers, a heading 
                for the graph, a polyline that changes in line weight and style (stroke to 
                dashed line) and descriptions above the polyline. All of this information 
                is displayed using different line weights and colours so that the graph 
                appears balanced while still being informative. Knaflic explains that 
                using lighter colours for information that provides a broader context 
                can ensure that the graph is not visually overwhelming. He also says 
                that data that is plotted as a single line (or polyline) should have 
                distinguishing aspects and I agree with this sentiment because adding 
                circles at the points in the line graph make the numerical values that 
                the graph is meant to represent easier to read.   
            </p>

                Visual hierarchy is an important component because it helps draw the reader&apos;s 
                eyes to the information they need to understand in the graph. Words I 
                the form of clear titles, labelling and annotations also make graphs more 
                accessible as they leave less to the imagination and this results in it 
                taking less time to interpret and understand the information being presented.   
            </p>
            <p>
                In Model Visual #3, the graph makes use of stacked bars that have been divided 
                into portions that represent a full 100%. The title of the graph states that 
                it is looking at “Goal attainment over time” but what stands out is the 
                information pertaining to missed goals that has been highlighted in a deep 
                red whilst the information about the goals that have been met or exceeded is 
                portrayed in varying shades of grey. The annotation at the top right also 
                states that more than a third of the projects are missing goals and this makes 
                me wonder if the red is depicting the absence of goals or the fact that the 
                goals have not been achieved.  This is where establishing what one wants to 
                communicate, keeping that message consistent and then applying the visual 
                hierarchy to the graph becomes important because what is emphasized does 
                not necessarily reflect what the title states the graph is trying to 
                highlight.  In this chapter, I think them main point Knaflic is trying to 
                push forward is the idea of telling a story, providing context and keeping 
                the narrative consistent.
