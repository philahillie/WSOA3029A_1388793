                The Rose Chart was a data visualisation used by Florence Nightingale during the Crimean 
                War that occurred from October 1853 to February 1856. The purpose of the 
                chart was to portray the different causes of death for each month during the 
                war. The chart depicted deaths from preventable or mitigable zymotic diseases 
                (signified by the blue), deaths from wounds (signified by the red) and deaths 
                from other causes (signified by the black). The black line across the red 
                triangle in November of 1854 signified the boundary of the deaths from all 
                other deaths during the month. The description also states that in October 
                of 1854 and April of 1855, the black area coincided with the red and in 
                January and February of 1856, the blue coincided with the black.

                This diagram was designed during a period of time described as &quot;The Golden 
                Age of statistical graphics&quot; (1850-1900). During this period, growth in 
                the importance of &quot;numerical information for social planning, 
                industrialisation, commerce and transportation occurred&quot; (Friendly. 
                2008). Graphics in the form of geometric shapes that could illustrate 
                volume or movement were developed. When looking at this chart and its 
                description, the use of geometric shapes and colour as opposed to using 
                drawing of people is what stood out to me. The geometric shapes helped 
                with communicating in a clearer way. However, it took me a while to 
                understand what the scale of the data was due to quantities not being 
                present and the presence of a key would have communicated what the 
                sections of the charts were representing a lot clearer than the 
                description that has been displayed in cursive font. This chart reads 
                as 3 different pie charts that have been layered on top of each other 
                and I wonder if a bar graph would have communicated the number of deaths 
                and their causes clearer.

                In &quot;Theories of Representation&quot;, Kidd suggests that infographics have become 
                increasingly complex and that is why they need to be simple in their 
                representation so that viewers are able to understand and interpret them. 
                Representation can be seen as the description or portrayal of something 
                and, in the case of data visualisation, is seen as the data that is 
                synthesised and depicted. Representation has a &quot;frustrated relationship 
                with reality&quot; (Kidd 2015) due to the fact that it needs to be portrayed 
                in a way that is accurate and understood by many people. I see and feel 
                this frustration when trying to understand the rose chart as the accuracy 
                of the information is unclear and be interpreted in many ways. An example 
                of this would be in the fact that the visibly larger surface is of the blue 
                section of the diagram could be interpreted as an increase in quantity or 
                the number of people. Had the chart had numbers and values present, the 
                number of deaths that Nightingale was trying to track could have been 
                communicated in a clearer way.
