        <h1>ANALYSIS OF DATA DRIVEN ART</h1>

        <article>
            <p>
                The data-driven art that have chosen to analyse is a campaign that looked at 
                translating endangered animal species and the number of animals left into a 
                visual. This project was first developed by Yoshiyuki Mikami and the World 
                Wildlife Fund in 2008. The idea was to create a series of images in which a 
                picture of an animal could only be made using the number of pixels that matched 
                the number of animals of that species that were still alive in the wild (i.e., 
                an image of a Bengal Tiger would be 2500 pixels as only 2500 tigers remained as 
                of 2008). This campaign inspired Joshua Smith, a programmer who took the idea 
                further and developed a Python script (Python is a coding language) that generates 
                images with correct number of pixels. The script generated these images based on 
                the endangered species list from Animal Planet. Although the images were not 
                completely accurate due to the fact that the number of pixels had to adjust 
                themselves to a square image and therefore be multiples of an identical number 
                of pixels (7 x 7 or 8 x 8), the point of the exercise was for viewers to see 
                that someone images were unrecognisable and hard to identify due to the number 
                of animals within that species being low thus the pixilation of the image was 
                bad. The Asian elephant image comprised of between forty thousand and fifty 
                thousand pixels which made them recognisable while animal species such as the 
                black footed ferret (the image was 300 pixels) and the Javan Rhino (the image 
                was 60 pixels) were unidentifiable in comparison, a portrait of a human would 
                need 7.53 billion pixels or 7.53 gigapixels in the image to be accurately 
                portrayed.

                When thinking about the endangered species, I understand that the numbers are 
                depleting at a rapid rate and that something needs to be done to ensure that 
                species do not go extinct. However, this project was interesting to me because 
                it allows viewers to see how close these animals are to being eradicated off the 
                face of the earth. The use of images that are so pixelated that they have become 
                unrecognisable appeals to the emotions of loss and memory, insinuating that these 
                animals will become a distant memory. Artistic strategies help explore topics that 
                cannot be put or fully comprehended into words and I feel that project begins to 
                put the topic of endangered animals into a perspective that is easier to 
                understand. When one looks at a pixelated image, they associate it with poor 
                image quality and when I see the pixelated images of the endangered animals, 
                I immediately think of poor quality and the what implications of losing more 
                animal species will have on our environment. This campaign invokes emotions of 
                shock, sadness and sympathy towards the animals whose numbers are dramatically 
                low.
