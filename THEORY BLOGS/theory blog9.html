                Semiotics or semiology refers to the study of signs, symbols and signification. 
                A signifier can be seen as any material thing that signifies while something 
                that is signified is the concept that a signifier refers to. For example, the 
                word &quot;rose&quot; is a signifier whilst the actual rose flower is the signified object. 
                The signifier and signified make up the sign which is the smallest unit of 
                meaning. Signs can be symbolic – the relation between signifier and signified 
                is conventional and culturally specific such as most words – or signs can be 
                iconic where the signifier and signified resemble each other (i.e., a picture).

                Interactivity refers to the process of two things working together and influencing 
                each other and this is similar to the idea of signifiers and signified objects 
                making up signs that can be used to communicate meanings. I understand 
                interactivity to be the process of transforming an input – which are the actions 
                of the user through the use of a mouse or interpretation – into an output that is 
                produced by the computer (Dimara and Perin). Therefore, I see interactivity as 
                a semiotic device through the fact that interactivity produces signs through 
                the collaboration of signifiers and signified objects or actions.

                In the example provided by InformationIsBeautiful.net is a dataset that displays 
                which fish are okay to eat. The visualisation allows users to choose a category 
                that they care about at the top of the visuals. Users can choose whether they care 
                about which fish has toxins, are cruel to catch, cause environmental harm or animal 
                welfare. Initially, I thought that clock on these categories would result in the 
                fish that pertain to that classification being highlighted while the other fish 
                would be less colourful or place in the background. The types of fish that apply 
                to each category are signified through the user hovering their mouse over each 
                category or set of words that can be seen as the signifier. In this case, the 
                signified and signifier communicated for information about the fish which have 
                represented in the table through the use of iconic signs (pictures) and symbolic 
                signs (words). The focus has been drawn to the &quot;YES&quot;, &quot;MAYBE&quot; and &quot;NO&quot; symbolic 
                signs on the left and the iconic signs on the right which are the different species 
                of fish. Colour and its intensity have been used to highlight the &quot;YES&quot; and &quot;NO&quot; 
                categories while the &quot;MAYBE&quot; category has been shown as grey and muted. This makes 
                the definitive yes and no categories easier to read.

                The secondary focus is on the second set of classifications that divide the fish 
                into farmed, Atlantic only, Atlantic and Pacific and Pacific only fish. This 
                information then corresponds with the tertiary element which is the interactive 
                hover device that has been added. This visualisation is interesting and informative 
                but I do wish that the interactive hover part of the visualisation was larger so 
                that it was easier to engage with and read.
