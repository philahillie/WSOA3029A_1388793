                    Data can be defined as unprocessed information and information can 
                    be viewed as data that has been processed. Data can be symbols or 
                    &quot;computerised representations&quot; of unprocessed information 
                    that has been collected and has no significance or meaning until it 
                    has been processed into a form of information that can be understood 
                    by people. Data can exist as primary or secondary data. Primary data 
                    is data that is collected from units or individual respondents and 
                    used for a specific study of information such as a census study. 
                    Secondary data has information that can be used from records, 
                    processed and statistically analysed to get information for multiple 
                    purposes. Primary data is considered raw data and secondary data is 
                    considered processed data (information).

                    Information refers to processed data that can be understood by and 
                    useful to people. It is collected and represented through numbers, 
                    graphical images and natural and artificial languages. It provides 
                    answers to questions and is given meaning through its ability to 
                    relatively connect data to people.

                    Data visualisation can be described as the use of graphical images 
                    of data or concepts that involves the exchange of information. This 
                    information can be used to help people make informed decisions and 
                    also process information that is relevant to the content they are 
                    engaging in. Data visualisation relies on computing technology and 
                    the connection between it and data in order to transform data into 
                    information that can be used by users. The use of interactive visual 
                    representations of data assist in the understanding of it. in
                    Data visualisation exists in two forms, information visualisation and 
                    scientific formation. Information visualisation is the process of 
                    representing abstract data in a visual way so that it can be understood 
                    by users. Scientific visualisation is the graphical representation 
                    of data as a means of obtaining comprehensive insight into scientific 
                    data and can also refer to visual data analysis.

                <p>
                    Information visualisation can be categorised in three parts and they are 
                    information as an organised arrangement of facts (i.e., a map), 
                    information presented as a means of understanding a process 
                    (i.e., a guide book) and the design of control systems (i.e., 
                    feedback controls of a product). Information visualisation is 
                    also seen as information design and information design prioritises 
                    designing an efficient communication of information.

                    Scientific visualisation can be expressed through graphical forms 
                    such as simulations, waveforms or volumes. These representations 
                    help convey data that has been explored and transformed to gain 
                    insight. It is common for scientific visualisation to use 3D modelling 
                    represent data that has several dimensions.

                    Readability, recognisability and meaning are important components of 
                    good data visualisation. Human perception also plays a big role in data 
                    visualisation and can improve the quality and quantity of information 
                    that is being displayed. Perception looks at the process of being aware 
                    of, gathering and storing and interpreting information. It links human 
                    senses to information and helps is the process human undergo to 
                    interpret the world around us. It helps us overcome the ambiguous 
                    nature of the world and the data within it.
