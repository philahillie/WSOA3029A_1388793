    <h1>What is Interaction for Data Visualisation?</h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin wrote this paper in an attempt to get 
            clarity on what interaction within the context of data visualisation means. 
            Without the given context, interaction means the &quot;communication or direct 
            involvement with someone or something&quot; and can also be seen as &quot;reciprocal 
            action or influence&quot; (Oxford Languages). Interaction is fundamental to 
            visualisations there is a barrier in achieving interaction with 
            visualisations (Dimara & Perin). This barrier is what led Dimara and Perin 
            to define what interaction for visualisation is so that it could be 
            eradicated. They first decided to send out paper to professions within 
            the field of data visualisation so that they could see if there was a 
            common thread or denominator in a possible universal definition. This 
            method alone was not efficient because it could potentially be biased by 
            then selection of submissions. This led to them sending out a questionnaire 
            and establishing a method for collecting and sorting through the 
            submissions. This four step process started at them having their own 
            list of &quot;definition papers&quot;, sending the questionnaire to expert 
            visualisation researchers who suggested both definition and linked papers, 
            they then sorted and categorised the answers (journals, conference papers, 
            non-peer entries etc.), and subsequently sent the questionnaires to authors 
            whose papers had been linked by the experts.

            They identified the emerging themes from the paper through the lens of 
            caption the current view of interaction in visualisation, the problems 
            raised by the community and the existing archetypal descriptions of 
            interactions. Interaction has been described as an “overloaded and elusive” 
            term and thus the definition for interaction for visualisation must involve 
            the mandatory components of interaction such as external and internal entities 
            and external and internal actions. The two most cited essential entities are 
            the user and the data. The user is a human being who is characterised by their 
            skills and expertise and initiates the interaction. With external entities, the 
            mean with which the user interacts with the data is a mediating entity that is 
            described as the visualisation system and also referred to as technology. 
            Internal entities can be characterised as goal-oriented intent or data exploration. 
            It can also be viewed as the user’s prior knowledge and can lead to the internalising of new goals depending on the visualisation. External actions can be seen as the dialogue between the user and the visualisation system which is made of action-reaction pairs. Internal actions involve the cognitive acts of the users and an analytic processing of the data.
