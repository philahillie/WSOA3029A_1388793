        A CLOSE ANALYSIS OF THE UX AND UI DESIGN OF THE SUPERBALIST WEBSITE
    </h1>

                Superbalist is an online store and website that I use often. The website 
                sells clothing, accessories, furniture and electronics. It took me a 
                fairly long time to trust and consider online shopping as an option so, 
                when I first discovered the website, I used it as a way of seeing what 
                clothes or shoes I was interested in possibly buying in stores and how 
                much I would need to budget for them. Superbalist acted as a browser 
                for clothes and shoes because it had an efficient searching and filter 
                system that helped me find what I was looking for and also recommended 
                similar options that I might also like. 
            </p>
            <p>
                User Experience (UX) can be understood as the purpose and functionality 
                of the product. Good UX reduces complaints from customers and is supposed 
                to increase a customerâ€™s trust in the brand. When I eventually decided 
                to use the online shopping services, I felt comfortable with trusting 
                them with my money because I had seen my peers purchase from them and 
                receive their order promptly and in good condition. I also appreciated 
                the follow up emails and communication throughout the delivery process. 
                UX can also refer to the structure of the website and the way products 
                are coded and displayed. Superbalist relies on visuals to display the 
                products they are selling. They also have filtering systems that help 
                users have better access to products for men, women and home products 
                such as furniture. 
            </p>
            <p>
                User Interface (UI) can be understood as the design attributes that 
                determine how easy a website or product is to engage with and how 
                well it performs. The Superbalist user interface is very easy to 
                engage with and I enjoy the many options one has when it comes to 
                deciding on the type of product you would like to purchase 
                (electronics, shoes, clothes etc.), the type of brand you would 
                like (through the use of filter functions on the site) and through 
                being able to place items in a cart or on a wish list so you can 
                purchase them later. I also appreciate their wait list feature where 
                they email you when an item that was sold out is now available for 
                purchase.

                Kidd discusses representation and how it can be shown through language 
                or, in the case of Superbalist, through the fact that this online 
                store is compiled of brands that are readily available to South 
                Africans and thus will not require interacting with customs 
                shipping or the fear of your items not making it to you promptly. 
                Superbalist also makes an effort to make their sales known to their 
                customers instead of hiding them and this is something I appreciate 
                when looking for items on a tighter budget.
