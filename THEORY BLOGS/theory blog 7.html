    In my first two data visualisations, I chose to look at the ratings of a show 
    called &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Through the use of the Internet Movie Database 
    (IMDb) web application programming interface (API), I was able to get insight 
    into how men and women of different age groups rated the television show. 
    Overall, the series got an aggregate rating of 9.2 out of 10. The age 
    groups I looked at were people younger than 18 years old, men and women 
    aged between 18 and 29 years old, 30 and 44 years old and men and women 
    older than 45 years old. Generally, the ratings across both genders and 
    most of the age groups were consistent and ranged between 9 and 10 out 
    10. The only group that was slightly different were women aged under 18 
    years old who rated the show an average of 7.4 out of 10.

    I wanted to use this information to look into how the show is received by 
    men and women. I can imagine that younger, teenage women would not enjoy the 
    show as much because of the violence and sexualisation of women that is 
    portrayed throughout the series. I initially wanted to make use of a line 
    graph however, the use of a scatter plot still communicated the values 
    whilst keeping the graphics simple. In hind sight, I would use a line 
    graph that has circles or dots at the dataâ€™s coordinates. I would also 
    find a way to make the axis slightly lighter so that the dots in the scatter 
    plot would be more emphasised. I initially wanted to start the numerical 
    values along the y-axis from 5 instead of zero as all the y-values were above 
    7 but then I wondered if that would remove the greater context of the rating 
    being out of 10 and decided to start the values at 0. I also considered adding 
    lines in the background of the graphs to help the viewers align the plotted 
    circles with the numerical values they were depicted but decided to keep the 
    graph simple.

    The website aims to give people reviews and insights of films and television 
    series. It goal is to appeals to film lovers and people looking for in depth 
    recommendations and reviews. I also wanted to create an environment where film 
    analysis and commentary felt like something that everyone could participate 
    in. This is why the use of simple, accessible and visually appealing summaries 
    of the data is integral. This graph is meant to share information about the
     Game of Thrones Ratings but also discuss what could have contributed to the 
     high ratings. Whilst the graph is the main focus, the article that it lies 
     within also provide context and further information about the data that has 
     be depicted.
